Current pipeline:
-makeNYGrid creates locations to query data
-2024 quieried at NYGrid locations using getHistoricalForecast
-filterHistoricalForecast removes grid points X km away from any windturbine locations
-XXXXX creates the covariance of data from filterHistoricalForecast
-XXXXX Optimizes information using K wind turbines
-XXXXX predicts wind energy generation for the next hour

Integrated pipeline
-Create a main file
-Query new monthly data at the end of every month and store
-filterHistoricalForecast is currently a script, turn its actions into functions
